    <h3>WHY I WANT TO VISIT SOUTH KOREA</h3>
    </div>
<div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Korea is well-known for its sophisticated technology and
	imaginative design, and I'd like to witness some of the most recent innovations in person. South Korea's natural beauty, such
	as its mountains and beaches, is extremely appealing to me. I'd want to go trekking and enjoy the great outdoors. Plus, I'm a
	fan of K-pop and Korean dramas and would want to see some of the filming places or witness a live performance. Finally, I want
	to learn about South Korea's distinct culture and traditions, such as sampling traditional Korean food and learning about the
	country's history.
