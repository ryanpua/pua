    <h3>WHY I WANT TO VISIT CANADA</h3>
    </div>
<div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada is known for its nice and
	inviting people, and as someone who enjoys meeting new people, I would want to experience it myself.
	I would visit Canada because it has breathtaking natural environment. There is no shortage of stunning
	locations to explore, from the majestic Rocky Mountains to the pristine lakes and forests of Ontario.
	Third, as a gourmet, I'd want to sample Canada's varied and delectable cuisine, which takes inspiration
	from a variety of cultural influences, including French, British, and indigenous traditions.
