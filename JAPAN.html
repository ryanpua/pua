    <h3>WHY I WANT TO VISIT JAPAN</h3>
    </div>
<div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm interested in Japanese pop culture, particularly
	anime and manga, and would want to visit locations relevant to these interests. Because Japan is famed for its
	technology and innovation, I would like to observe some of the most recent advances in person. Japan's natural beauty,
	such as Mount Fuji and cherry blossom trees, is very appealing to me. Finally, I wish to learn about Japan's distinct
	culture and customs, such as sampling traditional Japanese cuisine and visiting ancient temples and shrines.
