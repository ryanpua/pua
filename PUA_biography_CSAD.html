    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Ryan C. Pua Jr.<sup>1</sup> I was born on July 29, 2002, and I live in Caloocan city.<sup>2</sup> I have an older sister named Raven and two younger twin sisters Ryanah and Rshelah.<sup>3</sup> While growing up, I was raised by my aunt because my mother was sick and couldn't handle raising four kids.<sup>4</sup> When I was a child I am an energetic and curious child, always asking questions and exploring his surroundings.<sup>5</sup> My aunt taught me how to become a confident and bright child.<sup>6</sup> She always tells me to not get shy and be confident and because of that, I was always in plays, contests, or things that would be placed in the spotlight.<sup>7</sup> I am also a good student and consistently performed well in school.<sup>8</sup> I'm especially interested in science and math and because of that, I would always receive rewards like best in math, best in science, best in memory verse, etc.<sup>9</sup> I was always involved in the events of our local church with my aunt and I became a religious person. Our family loved road trips, I enjoyed going to different provinces and restaurants.<sup>10</sup>I would spend most of my time studying and memorizing because I don’t like playing outside our house.<sup>11</sup> I remember when my aunt got her first computer and she would let me use it if I finished my studies.<sup>12</sup> I was very fascinated with computers and it got to a point where I would secretly use them to play and stop studying even if the computer was meant to be used for studying.<sup>13</sup> My parents told me a story that happened when I was a child, they said that I got into an accident which resulted in getting stitches on my forehead.<sup>14</sup> I don’t really remember it happening, all I remember was I am already in a hospital bed with bandages on my head.<sup>15</sup> After that everything just went back to normal and I just played computer games like Farmville and Hangaroo.<sup>16</sup> My asthma would prevent me from playing outside and hanging out with other people so I relied on computers for my entertainment.<sup>17</sup> At that time my goals were very typical and very childlike.<sup>18</sup> I would often tell that I would like to be a pilot or a doctor and when I think about it right now I can say that I was very different when I was a child.<sup>19</sup> Sometimes I would think about what is my personality if I didn’t change so much.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next in my autobiography is my teenage years.<sup>1</sup> Starting junior high school, I moved to a new school near our place.<sup>2</sup> Everything felt new but I didn’t know anyone.<sup>3</sup> I struggled with making friends and became very introverted.<sup>4</sup> My routine was to go to school and return home when classes end it’s why I didn’t have opportunities to make friends.<sup>5</sup> Group activities were a very hard obstacle for me, I don’t have friends to create groups and sometimes I would do group projects alone.<sup>6</sup> That time I also discovered anime.<sup>7</sup> It became my new source of entertainment and there were times when I would watch anime continuously without sleeping.<sup>8</sup> Sometimes I would get into an argument with my older sister just to watch anime on our television.<sup>9</sup> It hindered me and my time to study or do anything which resulted in my grades getting lower.<sup>10</sup> After that, I became hooked on video games.<sup>11</sup> I would play games like Tekken, Mario, Final Fantasy, and God of War.<sup>12</sup> I was a really hard time when my console broke and my parents didn’t want to get it fixed.<sup>13</sup> That is the reason why I always spent my time using computers and playing computer games.<sup>14</sup> I became addicted and my parents confiscated and timed my use of computers, because of that experience of going into computer shops.<sup>15</sup> I also made friends that taught me how to play League of Legends.<sup>16</sup>  Like me, they also loved watching anime and reading manga.<sup>17</sup> My high school friends are the ones that taught me that going outside my comfort zone is also fun and exciting.<sup>18</sup> These are the times that I never thought about studying and I did what I want to do.<sup>19</sup> But still, l had a keen interest in science and technology and was interested in pursuing a career in the medical field.<sup>20</sup> When I reached 11th grade I kinda regret neglecting my studies since I was not able to apply for college entrance exams because my grades were not enough for me to apply.<sup>21</sup></p>

    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part is about my college years until the present.<sup>1</sup> I would say that my college experience started very late due to the pandemic.<sup>2</sup> When I started first-year college, I didn’t really feel like anything interesting would happen to me.<sup>3</sup> Yes, there were good things that happen, but it was all outside school and it was when I’m with my friends from junior high school.<sup>4</sup> I felt like I spent more time procrastinating than studying.<sup>5</sup> Sometimes I think that I’m losing interest in computer science because being a nurse was my first choice but I can’t really see myself studying for long periods and I think I don’t deserve the course and that’s why I picked computer science since it was my second choice from the courses that I want.<sup>6</sup> Most of the time I would go out since online classes weren’t that time-consuming.<sup>7</sup> I would explore a lot of restaurants and places by myself or with my friends and when I’m not outside I would just play video games or sleep to pass time.<sup>8</sup> Watching anime and live-action series turned into an everyday thing for me and yes every now and then I wouldn’t sleep until I finished the whole series or season.<sup>9</sup> My passion for anime and manga never faded, and I continued to attend conventions and watch new series.<sup>10</sup> I’ve attended events like CosMatsuri or Cosplay Mania but I didn’t wear a cosplay.<sup>11</sup> As time passed I discovered a love for coding and began exploring a lot of things about programming.<sup>12</sup> I just love the feeling when my program works or when I discover something that would fix my program.<sup>13</sup> Web design also piqued my interest because I didn’t know that there are so many factors that web design has.<sup>14</sup> I liked it even if I’m not good at designing things but I want to learn.<sup>15</sup> When face-to-face classes started, I felt motivated to study again and aim for higher grades.<sup>16</sup> Managing my time is my challenge this semester and I want to fix my sleep schedule so that I won’t always get sleepy in class.<sup>17</sup> I can also go out a lot this semester because of the face-to-face classes, I can properly interact with my classmates and go out with my friends from universities near UE.<sup>18</sup> I want to graduate college so that I can pursue game development.<sup>19</sup> Lastly, I want to overcome my introverted nature and push myself out of my comfort zone.<sup>20</sup></p>
