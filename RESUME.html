<blockquote> <p>I'm a highly motivated individual with a passion for gaming and technology. Born on July 29, 2002, I am currently residing in Caloocan, Metro Manila, Philippines. I have always been fascinated by the gaming industry and interested in game development jobs. Currently studying Computer Science at the University of the East, where I have been developing my programming skills and building a foundation in different kinds of programming languages. I want to hone my programming skills more in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python because learning to program is becoming more and more necessary as technology's significance in our world increases.</p> </blockquote>
