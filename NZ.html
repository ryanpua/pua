    <h3>WHY I WANT TO VISIT NEW ZEALAND</h3>
    </div>
<div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote style="color:#F1DBBF;">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would visit New Zealand because of its breathtaking natural
	environment. The country's scenery are genuinely magnificent, from the rocky Southern Mountains to the crystal-clear lakes
	and beaches. New Zealand has a vibrant indigenous Maori culture, and I'd want to learn more about its history and traditions.
	The amicable and laid-back attitude of the nation is definitely a big lure for me. I'd want to take up the laidback environment
	and enjoy the great welcome of the Kiwi people. Finally, I'd like to try some of New Zealand's distinctive cuisine, which
	includes fresh fish, lamb meals, and Maori delicacies like hangi (a traditional feast cooked in an earth oven).
