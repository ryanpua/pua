        <h1 align = "center">Bucket list</h1>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a solo road trip. I want to experience traveling alone, i feel like it is a great way
		to recharge and explore at my own pace. Explore the open road, stopping at scenic spots along the way.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore a new city or country. I love people-watching and soaking up the ambiance of a new place, while
		taking a walking tour of a city or neighborhood. This can be a great way to discover
		hidden gems and get a sense of the local culture.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go stargazing. I love spending time in nature, there's nothing quite like a clear night sky full
		of stars. Camping in a remote location or finding a local stargazing group to join.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn a new language. For a trip to a foreign country or simply to challenge myself
		intellectually, learning a new language can be a fun and fulfilling experience.</p>
 
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend a music festival or concert.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try a new cuisine. Food is a universal language, and trying new dishes can be a great way to explore
		different cultures and expand my culinary horizons.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a class or workshop. Whether it's cooking, painting, or photography, taking a class or workshop
		can be a great way to learn new skills and meet like-minded individuals.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate college. Excitement, bittersweet, pride, anxiousness, and love. We can only imagine the feelings bubbling
		through our minds. What am I gonna feel when I graduate?
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn a new instrument or form of art. Whether  painting, sculpture, or music,
		exploring a new form of art can be a great way to express myself and tap into creativity.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit a natural wonder.</p>
		
		<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a hot air balloon ride. Seeing the world from a new perspective can be a magical experience, and a hot air balloon
		ride can offer a unique and memorable way to do just that.</p>
